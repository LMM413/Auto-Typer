# Auto-Typer

**To uninstall**, all you need to do is delete the .exe file. The script and database used are fully contained into that .exe and nothing else is installed onto your system beides temp files when the software runs, these are deleted when it is closed. In the case of a crash or sudden closure it is possible these files are not removed, they should be deleted upon opening and closing the software again.

## Features Include
- Start / stop via custom hotkey
- Estimated time to type and WPM
- Human speed typing with random speed assigned to blocks of letters along with more random speeds for each letter alone
- Dark themed UI made via tkinter
- Controllable font size for entered text
- Full control over all variables that affect typing
- 3 presets to mimic different typing styles

This program is once again, meant to simulate a human typing to some degree, not be instant and perfect.
